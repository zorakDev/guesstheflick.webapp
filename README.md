"Guess the Flick" app is a fun game that challenges you to guess a random movie name from an image with a selection of title options. The app uses The Movie Database API to get information about movies and movie genres and allows the user to choose a genre to focus their gameplay on. The objective is to accumulate points by correctly guessing the title of the movie before you run out of lives. In more recent versions of the app, which continues to be developed for mobile, it also uses Firebase for authentication and score tracking. The app is written in Dart using the Flutter framework.

This is the web build version that can be viewed from a browser, it is not the source code.

It is currently continuing its development only as a mobile app with many improvements.
